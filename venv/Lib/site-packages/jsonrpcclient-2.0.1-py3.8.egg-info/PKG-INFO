        *************
        
        Make `remote procedure calls
        <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call>`_ with `JSON-RPC
        <http://www.jsonrpc.org/>`_.
        
        .. sourcecode:: sh
        
            $ pip install jsonrpcclient requests
        
        Simply set the server details, then make a request:
        
        .. sourcecode:: python
        
            >>> from jsonrpcclient.http_server import HTTPServer
            >>> server = HTTPServer('http://example.com/api')
            >>> server.request('add', 2, 3)
            5

        Recent Changes
        ==============
        
        2.0.1 (2015-09-04)
        ------------------
        
        A major update. These changes open up the module for communication protocols
        other than just HTTP.
        
        - Importantly, the ``Server`` class has been renamed ``HTTPServer``. Adjust
          your code like this:
        
        .. sourcecode:: python
        
            >>> from jsonrpcclient.http_server import HTTPServer
            >>> server = HTTPServer('http://example.com/api')
        
        - The requests module, which is required to send requests over HTTP, will no
          longer be installed as a dependency. It's now up to the user to install it
          like this:
        
        .. sourcecode:: sh
        
            $ pip install jsonrpcclient requests
        
        - Three exceptions have been removed: ``InvalidRequest`` (out of scope),
          ``InvalidResponse`` (catch ``jsonschema.ValidationError`` instead) and
          ``ConnectionError`` (catch the `requests module exceptions
          <http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/api/#exceptions>`_ instead).
        
        - Faster validation of response messages.
        
        - Requests are now sent and logged with the JSON-RPC parts in the right order,
          (beginning with ``'jsonrpc': 2.0'`` etc.), which is just nicer to read.
        
        - `ZeroMQ <http://jsonrpcclient.readthedocs.org/zmq_server.html>`_ protocol
          added.
        
        - `Documentation <http://jsonrpcclient.readthedocs.org/>`_ overhauled.
        
        - Other fixes and improvements.

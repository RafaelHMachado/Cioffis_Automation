        Recent Changes
        ==============
        
        3.1.1 (2015-10-27)
        ------------------
        
        - Notifications are no longer responded to, not even if there's an error. This
          is a `requirement <http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#notification>`__ of
          the JSON-RPC specification. However, it can be overridden when calling
          `dispatch()
          <https://jsonrpcserver.readthedocs.org/api.html#dispatcher.dispatch>`__, to
          force notifications to receive errors.
        
        - Error responses can now be `configured
          <https://jsonrpcserver.readthedocs.org/api.html#exceptions>`__ by monkey
          patching.
        
        - The HTTP status returned to notifications, which is 204 by default, can be
          `configured
          <https://jsonrpcserver.readthedocs.org/api.html#response.NotificationResponse.http_status>`__
          by monkey patching.
        
        3.1.0 (2015-10-17)
        ------------------
        
        `dispatch()
        <https://jsonrpcserver.readthedocs.org/api.html#dispatcher.dispatch>`__ now
        accepts a dictionary of name:method pairs, as an alternative to the usual list
        of methods.
        
        3.0.0 (2015-10-11)
        ------------------
        
        Major update - much of the library has been rewritten. Although it works in much
        the same way as before, upgraders are advised to read the new `documentation
        <http://jsonrpcserver.readthedocs.org/>`__ to pick up the changes.
